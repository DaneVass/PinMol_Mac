Requirements for running PinMol on Mac:

1. You need Python 3.x (with pandas, Biopython)

2. You need RNAstructure text interface (you must register to access download):
    http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html

3. Add the following lines to the .bash_profile or .profile file:

export PATH="[RNAstructure_directory]/RNAstructure/exe:$PATH"
export DATAPATH="[RNAstructure_path]/RNAstructure/data_tables/"

#example If RNAstructure was installed in /Users/MyAccount/Desktop use: 

export PATH="/Users/MyAccount/Desktop/RNAstructure/exe:$PATH"

4. Open a terminal window, go into the PinMol directory and run:
$ python pinmol_mac.py
